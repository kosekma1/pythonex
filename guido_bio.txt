I am the author of the Python programming language. See also my resume and my publications list, 
a brief bio, assorted writings, presentations and interviews (all about Python), some pictures 
of me, my new blog, and my old blog on Artima.com. I am @gvanrossum on Twitter. 
I also have a G+ profile.

In January 2013 I joined Dropbox. I work on various Dropbox products and have 50% for my Python work, 
no strings attached. Previously, I have worked for Google, Elemental Security, Zope Corporation, 
BeOpen.com, CNRI, CWI, and SARA. (See my resume.) I created Python while at CWI.
